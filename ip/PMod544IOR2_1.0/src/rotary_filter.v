// -----------------
//	15-Mar-2014		RK		Created this module from the one I've used for years in ECE 540 and 544
//	
// Description:
// ------------
// This module encodes the A and B quadrature input from the rotary encoder to two signals
// The "rotary_event" output  is pulsed when the rotary encoder knob is turned in either
// direction.  The "rotary_left" output indicates which direction the knob was turned.  A 1 on
// "rotary_left" indicates the knob was turned to the left, a 0 indicates the knob was turned
// to the right
//
// NOTE:  This module assumes that the input clock is running much faster than the knob can
// be turned.
